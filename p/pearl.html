      The theme for the <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam 2017</a> was <i>waves</i> and because it was my first GameJam, I decided to keep it simple. I partecipated with a friend and we had a lot of fun!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our idea was to make a <i>Layton</i> style puzzle game with a seaside theme and use the movement of waves to solve it. We used <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> with scripts in C# and I used <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a> to draw the assets.

      Here's how you play it. By pressing the directional arrows you move all the movable pieces on the grid by 1 step in the direction you chose. Your goal is to place all the pearls back to the corresponding shell.
    </p>

      After the 48 hours we eneded up with the two working levels that you can see below.
