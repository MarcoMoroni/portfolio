    <p>
      I made this portfolio to show my love for UI and UX design. Unfortunately I'm not studying this topics at university, but I like to think I understand the basic concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to write here how I made decisions for colours, layouts and navigation, but also what I'm aware can be improved. These were the points around which this site has been made:
    </p>
    <ul class="no-bottom-margin">
      <li>the goal is to show my projects;</li>
      <li>I need to show good UI design;</li>
      <li>visitors will probably not read much in detail;</li>
      <li>it has to be easy to code (I'm not a web dev).</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h3>Structure and navigation</h3>
    <p>
      A one-page website would not work, because between text and images, there is too much content to fit one single page. So I went for a classic site, with a home page and secondary pages, one for each project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of the home page is to show my whole portfolio at a glance: I made a grid with big divs showing a preview of each project and a small abstract.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you open a secondary page you immediately see a line of small rectangles on the top of the page: they are there to show where you are on the site. It's a common UI element, usually made by circles. Here I'm using rectangles, that resemble the ones in the home page (as you are now "inside" one of them).
    </p>
    <p>
      After that you see the same abstract present on the home page. This is included because you can navigate from a secondary page directly to another secondary page, without going back to the home: you need to know what the project is about, no matter where you're accessing the page from.
    </p>
    <p class="no-bottom-margin">
      At the bottom of a secondary page there are navigation buttons: a home button and a button to go to the next project. I didn't include a "previous project" button as I don't think it would be necessary.
    </p>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h3>Colours</h3>
    <p>
      There is an overall monochromatic theme with only one accent colour used moslty only for intractable elements.
    </p>
    <p class="no-bottom-margin">
      One problem I'm aware of is in the home page. The project previews have an overlay, probably too opaque, even though they should be the most important thing. I decided to keep it anyway, not only because it looks nicer, but because if you're here to read my portfolio, you're definetly going to open the secondary pages, where you can see all the images.
