    <p>
      I made this portfolio to show my love for UI and UX design. Unfortunately I'm not studying this topics at university, but I like to think I understand the basic concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to write here how I made decisions for colour, layouts and navigation, but also what I'm aware can be improved.
    </p>
    <p class="no-bottom-margin">
      Even though I put a lot of effort into this website, I'm not a web developer. Please keep this in mind.
    </p>

    <h3>Structure and navigation</h3>
    <p>
      A one-page website would not work, because between text and images, there is too much content to fit one single page. So I went for a classic site, with a home page and secondary pages, one for each project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of the home page is to show my whole portfolio at a glance: after a few small presentation paragraphs I added a grid with big divs showing a preview of each project and a small abstract. By clicking on one you open the corresponding secondary page.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you open a secondary page you immediately see a line of small rectangles on the top of the page: they are there to show where you are on the site. It's a common UI element, usually made by circles. Here I'm using rectangles, that resemble the ones in the home page (as you are now "inside" one of them).
    </p>
    <p>
      After that you see the same abstract present on the home page and it has the same dimension and font to look identical. This is included because you can navigate from a secondary page directly to another secondary page, without going back to the home: you need to know what the project is about, no matter where you're accessing the page from.
    </p>
    <p class="no-bottom-margin">
      At the bottom of a secondary page there are navigation buttons: a home button and a button to go to the next project. I didn't include a "previous project" button as I don't think it would be necessary.
    </p>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h3>Colours</h3>
    <p>
      There is an overall dark theme with only one accent colour used moslty only for intractable elements: green.
    </p>
    <p>
      One problem I'm aware of is in the home page. The project previews have a dark overlay, probably too dark, even though they should be the most important thing. I decided to keep it anyway, not only because it looks nicer, but because if you're here to read my portfolio, you're definetly going to read the secondary pages. So you should still get an idea of what the projects are about.
    </p>
    <p class="no-bottom-margin">
      The contrast between background and text is not extremely high, but I'm quite sure it is enough.
