      This is a set of physics-based animations I made at university using C++ and verything was made by scratch.

    <h3>Flag</h3>
    <p>
      The project started by implementing forces such as gravity towards the ground and aerodynamic drag followed by collison with an horizontal plane. The particles here are connected by a new set of forces—a system of springs—which orthogonally connect them to create a cloth.
    </p>
    <p class="no-bottom-margin">
      Another force to simulate an isotropic wind has been applied, but this time it affects all the triangles of the triangulated cloth.

    <h3>Point gravity</h3>
    <p>
      All the simulations use a simple gravity the pushes bodies vertically to the ground, so I decided to experimented with different types of gravity. I made this and the 2 following simulations.
    </p>
    <p class="no-bottom-margin">
      Here you can see a group of particles that are affected by two point of gravity. The gravity is stronger the close to this points and null after a certain distnce.

    <h3>Newton's gravity between any two bodies</h3>
    <p class="no-bottom-margin">
      While the previous simulation does not use any physically correct formula, this uses Newton's law of gravity, therfore now every particle with mass is affected by every other one's mass. To be able to see such interactions I decided to make them stick together once they get really close and to enclose them inside a box.

    <h3><i>Super Mario Galaxy</i>'s gravity</h3>
    <p>
      In <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> the player is able to walk in planetoids of any shape and size. This is possible because bodies are affected by the gravity of only one planetoid and the gravity direction is the inverse of the normal of (usually) the closest suface.
    </p>
    <p class="no-bottom-margin">
      I've managed to apply this to particles in a planetoid with the shape of a box. The gravity direction is the normalised vector from the particle to a point <i>U</i>, where <i>U</i> is the point on (or in) the planetoid closest to the particle.
